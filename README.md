Repository for TSA Data Science &amp; Analytics 2025 competition.

Thank you for looking at my GitHub repo! Here are a few quick notes about where everything is located. 

- Dataset: This is the dataset that I used before cleaning. Data from Numbeo.
- Data_Visualizations: This is the code to create the data visualizations. This code was originally developed in VSCode Studio and uploaded to GitHub files.
